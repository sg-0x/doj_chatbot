The Supreme Court examined the report in full and accepted the recommendations of the FNJPC with various modifications and directed all State Governments to implement it vide Order dated 21.03.2002.

Government of India does not interfere in the functioning of the Judiciary. The administrative/ disciplinary control over the members of subordinate judiciary in the States vests with the concerned High Court and the respective State Government. The State Government frames Rules and Regulation in consultation with the respective High Courts. Central Government neither maintains records related to any court proceedings/ decisions / judgments nor does it have and can have a mechanism to monitor the action taken on them. No administrative action can be taken on a grievance; subject matter of which is subjudice. Government cannot ask a Court of Law to expedite proceedings of any particular case. Therefore, no action can be taken by the Government where the petitioner is aggrieved of the fact that there has been inordinate delay in disposal of the case. A judicial order can be challenged only before appropriate Court of Law as per prescribed legal procedure. Therefore, it is a futile exercise to file a grievance against a judicial order/judgement. A grievance regarding a complaint against a Judge can be taken up for inquiry by the concerned High Court or Supreme Court as per in-house procedure adopted by them. There is no role of Government in disposal of such grievances. Detailed guidelines on grievances received in the Department of Justice are available on this Departments website doj.gov.in. As per guidelines issued by the Supreme Court of India, grievances against Judicial Officers are required to be sent on sworn affidavit with verifiable facts to the Registrar General of the concerned High Court. Petitions, applications and other documents to be filed before a Court of Law should not be forwarded alongwith grievances as these are to be presented in person or by a duly authorised agent or by an advocate on record duly appointed for the purpose. As Judiciary is independent and Government does not interfere in the functioning of the Judiciary, no further follow-up or correspondence is made by the Government after forwarding of grievance to the concerned High Court or Supreme Court, as the case may be.

Government of National Capital Territory considered this request and observed that increasing the pecuniary jurisdiction would lessen the burden on High Court and there would be substantive improvement in disposal of cases in subordinate courts, since number of subordinate Courts has now increased due to creation of eleven Districts in Delhi. Enhancement of pecuniary jurisdiction of Delhi District Courts will facilitate access of general public to the District Courts within the vicinity of their location. Moreover, this would also be helpful to litigants in providing Justice at Doorstep due to the location of District Courts in different parts of Delhi. The proposal received from the Govt. of NCT of Delhi seeking amendments in the Delhi High Court Act, 1966 to provide for enhancing the pecuniary limits of the District Courts of Delhi from the existing Rs.20 lakhs to Rs.2 crore was examined and a Bill viz., The Delhi High Court (Amendment) Bill, 2015 was introduced in the Parliament. The said Bill was considered and passed by both the Houses of Parliament. The Bill received the assent of the President President of India on 10.08.2015 and has been brought into force w.e.f.26.10.2015. Increasing the pecuniary jurisdiction of district Courts of Delhi would lessen the burden of Delhi High Court and there would be substantive improvement in disposal of cases in subordinate Courts. This will facilitate access of the general public to 11 District Courts located in 6 District Court Complexes within the vicinity of their location, ensuring speedy justice to the litigants at their door steps.

In case of initial appointment of a Chief Justice of a High Court, the provisions of Article 217 will have to be followed. In the case of Jammu &amp; Kashmir High Court, appointment of Chief Justice shall be made in accordance with section 95 of the Constitution of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Transfer of Chief Justice from one High Court to another will be governed by the provision of Article 222. Transfer of a Chief Justice to and from Jammu &amp; Kashmir High Court shall be made in accordance with clause (1) of Article 222 of the Constitution of India read with Article 222(1A) of the Constitution (Application to Jammu &amp; Kashmir) Order, 1954. For purposes of elevation as Chief Justices the inter-se seniority of puisne Judges will be reckoned on the basis of their seniority in their own High Courts and they will be considered for appointment as Chief Justices in other High Courts when their turn would normally have come for being considered for such appointment in their own High Courts. A puisne Judge in a High Court who has one year or less to retire when his turn for being considered for elevation as Chief Justice arrives may be considered for appointment as Chief Justice in his own High Court if vacancy is to occur in the office of the Chief Justice in that High Court during that period. Initiation of the proposal for the appointment of Chief Justice of a High Court would be by the Chief Justice of India. The process of appointment must be initiated well in time to ensure the completion at least one month prior to the date of anticipated vacancy for the Chief Justice of the High Court. The Chief Justice of India would ensure that when a Chief Justice is transferred from one High Court to another simultaneous appointment of his successor in office should be made and ordinarily the arrangement of appointment of an acting Chief Justice should not be made for more than one month. The Chief Justice of India would send his recommendation for the appointment of a puisne Judge of the High Court as Chief Justice of that High Court or of another High Court, in consultation with the two senior- most Judges of the Supreme Court. He would also ascertain the views of the seniormost colleague in the Supreme Court who is conversant with the affairs of the High Court in which the recommendee has been functioning and whose opinion is likely to be significant in adjudging the suitability of the candidate. It is of no consequence whether the Judge of the Supreme Court, so consulted, had that High Court as Parent High Court or was transferred there from any other High Court. The views of the Judges of the Supreme Court thus consulted would then be sent by the Chief Justice of India alongwith his proposal, to the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs. After receipt of the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India, the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs would obtain the views of the concerned State Government. After receipt of the views of the State Government, the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs, will submit proposals to the Prime Minister, who will then advise the President as to the selection. As soon as the appointment is approved by the President, the Department of Justice will announce the appointment and issue necessary notification in the Gazette of India. APPOINTMENT OF ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE Appointment of Acting Chief Justices is to be made by the President under Article 223 of the Constitution. Intimation from the Chief Justice about his proceeding on leave or being unable to perform the duties of the Office of Chief Justice must be sent to all concerned well in advance to make arrangement for appointment of Acting Chief Justice. When it is proposed to appoint the seniormost puisne Judge on duty, as Acting Chief Justice, as soon as above intimation is received, the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs in the Central Government would appoint the seniormost puisne Judge and the Secretary to the Government of India in the Department of Justice will, inform the Chief Minister and announce the appointment and issue the necessary notification in the Gazette of India. 10. Where, however, it is proposed to appoint an Acting Chief Justice, other than the seniormost puisne Judge the procedure for appointment of a regular Chief Justice as prescribed above will have to be followed. APPOINTMENT OF PERMANENT JUDGES The Chief Justice and Judges of the High Courts are to be appointed by the President under clause (1) of Article 217 of the Constitution. The Judges of the Jammu &amp; Kashmir High Court are to be appointed by the President under section 95 of the Constitution of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Appointments to the High Court should be made on a time bound schedule so that the appointments are made well in advance preferably a month before the occurrence of the anticipated vacancy. When a permanent vacancy is expected to arise in any year in the office of a Judge, the Chief Justice will as early as possible but at least 6 months before the date of occurrence of the vacancy, communicate to the Chief Minister of the State his views as to the persons to be selected for appointment. Full details of the persons recommended, in the format given in Annexure-I should invariably be sent. Before forwarding his recommendation, the Chief Justice must consult two of his seniormost colleagues on the Bench regarding the suitability of the names proposed. All consultation must be in writing and these opinions must be sent to the Chief Minister along with the recommendations. The Chief Justice while sending his recommendation for appointing an additional Judge as a permanent Judge, must along with his recommendation furnish statistics of monthwise disposal of cases and judgments rendered by the Judge concerned as well as the number of cases reported in the Law Journal duly certified by him. The information would also be furnished regarding the total number of working days, the number of days he actually attended the court and the days of his absence from the Court during the period for which the disposal statistics are sent. The proposal for appointment of a Judge of a High Court shall be initiated by the Chief Justice of the High Court. However, if the Chief Minister desires to recommend the name of any person he should forward the same to the Chief Justice for his consideration. Since the Governor is bound by the advice of the Chief Minister heading the Council of Ministers, a copy of the Chief Justices proposal, with full set of papers, should simultaneously be sent to the Governor to avoid delay. Similarly, a copy thereof may also be endorsed to the Chief Justice of India and the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs to expedite consideration. The Governor as advised by the Chief Minister should forward his recommendation along with the entire set of papers to the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs as early as possible but not later than six weeks from the date of receipt of the proposal from the Chief Justice of the High Court. If the comments are not received within the said time frame, it should be presumed by the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs that the Governor (i.e. Chief Minister) has nothing to add to the proposal and proceed accordingly. The Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs would consider the recommendations in the light of such other reports as may be available to the Government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete material would then be forwarded to the Chief Justice of India for his advice. The Chief Justice of India would, in consultation with the two seniormost Judges of the Supreme Court, form his opinion in regard to a person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. The Chief Justice of India and the collegium of two Judges of the Supreme Court would take into account the views of the Chief Justice of the High Court and of those Judges of the High Court who have been consulted by the Chief Justice as well as views of those Judges in the Supreme Court who are conversant with the affairs of that High Court. It is of no consequence whether that High Court is their parent High Court or they have functioned in that High Court on transfer. After their consultations, the Chief Justice of India will in course of 4 weeks send his recommendation to the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs. Consultation by the Chief Justice of India with his colleagues should be in writing and all such exchange of correspondence with his colleagues would be sent by the Chief Justice of India to the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs. Once the names have been considered and recommended by the Chief Justice of India, they should not be referred back to the State Constitutional authorities even if a change takes place in the incumbency of any post. However, where it is considered expedient to refer back the names, the opinion or Chief Justice of India should be obtained. The Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs would then put up as early as possible, preferably, within 3 weeks, the recommendation or the Chief Justice of India to the Prime Minister who will advise the President in the matter of appointment. The correspondence between the Chief Justice and the Chief Minister and the correspondence between the Chief Minister and the Governor, if any, should be in writing and copies of the correspondence should invariably be forwarded along with the Chief Ministers recommendations. As soon as the appointment is approved by the President, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Department of Justice will inform the Chief Justice of the High Court, who will obtain from the person selected (i)a certificate of physical fitness as in Annexure II signed by a Civil Surgeon or District medical officer, and (ii)a certificate of date of birth as in Annexure III. A copy of the communication will also be sent simultaneously to the Chief Minister of the State. The medical certificates should be obtained from all persons selected for appointment whether they are at the time of appointment in the service of the State or not. When these documents are obtained, the Chief Justice will intimate the fact to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Department of Justice and also forward these documents to him. As soon as the warrant of appointment is signed by the President, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Department of Justice will inform the Chief Justice and a copy of such communication will be sent to the Chief Minister. He will also announce the appointment and issue necessary notification in the Gazette of India. APPOINTMENT OF PERMANENT JUDGES IN A HIGH COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER MORE THAN ONE STATE: 19. For appointments in these High Courts, the Chief Justice would initiate proposal in a manner prescribed in para 12 above and forward his recommendations to the Governor of the State where the seat of High Court is situated, and in the case of High Court of Punjab &amp; Haryana, to the senior of the two Governors of these States, who would do the coordination and obtain the views of other Governor and Chief Ministers concerned in writing and forward the same along with the recommendations of the Chief Justice of the High Court to the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs for further appropriate action as prescribed in para 15 above. In case, any of the State authorities wishes to recommend a name different from the one recommended by the Chief Justice of the High Court, he should send the same to the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned for his consideration. The initiation of a recommendation for filling up of a vacancy would be made only by the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned. APPOINTMENT OF ADDITIONAL JUDGES Additional Judges can be appointed by the President under clause (1) of Article 224 of the Constitution. When the need for this arises, the State Government should first obtain the sanction of the Central Government for the creation of such additional posts. The correspondence relating to this should be in the normal official form. After the post is sanctioned the procedure to be followed for making the appointment will be same as given in paragraphs 12 to 18 for the appointment of a permanent Judge, except that a medical certificate will not be necessary from the person being appointed as an Additional Judge. When an Additional Judge is being considered for confirmation as an Additional Judge for a fresh term, the relevant documents as mentioned in para 13 above also must be sent by the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned along with such recommendation. The Chief Justice of the High Court, however, should not make a recommendation for appointment of an Additional Judge when a vacancy of a permanent Judge is available in that High Court. APPOINTMENT OF ACTING JUDGES Acting Judges can be appointed by the President under clause (2) of Article 224 of the Constitution. Such appointments will not, however, be made for periods of less than three months unless there are special reasons for doing so. When occasion arises for making such an appointment, the same procedure will be followed, as given in paragraphs 12 to 18 for the appointment of a permanent Judge, except that a medical certificate will not be necessary from the person appointed as Acting Judge. Ordinarily, members of the Bar should for obvious reasons not be suggested for appointment as Acting Judges. ATTENDANCE OF RETIRED JUDGES AT SITTINGS OF HIGH COURTS Under Article 224A of the Constitution, the Chief Justice of a High Court may at any time, with the previous consent of the President, request any person who has held the office of a Judge of that court or of any other High Court to sit and act as a Judge of the High Court of that State. Whenever the necessity for such an appointment arises, the Chief Justice will after obtaining the consent of the person concerned, communicate to the Chief Minister of the State the name of the retired Judge and the period for which he will be required to sit and act as Judge of the High Court. The Chief Minister will, after consultation with the Governor, forward his recommendation to the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs. The Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs would then consult the Chief Justice of India in accordance with the prescribed procedure. On receipt of CJIs advice, the same would be put up to the Prime Minister, who will then advise the President as to the person to be appointed to it and act as a Judge of the High Court. As soon as the President gives his consent to the appointment, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Department of Justice will inform the Chief Justice of the High Court and the Chief Minister(s) and will issue the necessary notification in the Gazette of India. TRANSFER OF A JUDGE (INCLUDING CHIEF JUSTICE) FROM ONE HIGH COURT TO ANOTHER HIGH COURT: Article 222 of the Constitution makes provision for the transfer of a Judge (including Chief Justice) from one High Court to any other High Court. The initiation of the proposal for the transfer of a Judge should be made by the Chief Justice of India whose opinion in this regard is determinative. Consent of a Judge for his first or subsequent transfer would not be required. All transfers are to be made in public interest i.e. for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. In the formation of his opinion for the transfer of a Judge, other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of India is expected to take into account the views of the Chief Justice of the High Court from which the Judge is to be transferred, as also the Chief Justice of the High Court to which the transfer is to be effected. The Chief Justice of India should also take into account the views of one or more Supreme Court Judges who are in a position to offer his/their views which would assist in the process of deciding whether or not a proposed transfer should take place. In the case of transfer of a Chief Justice, only the views of one or more knowledgeable Supreme Court Judges need to be taken into account. The views on the proposed transfer of a Judge or a Chief Justice of a High Court should be expressed in writing and should be considered by the Chief Justice of India and the four seniormost Judges of the Supreme Court. The personal factors relating to the concerned Judge, including the Chief Justice, and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the Chief Justice of India and the first four puisne Judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at conclusion on the proposal. The proposal for transfer of the Judge, including the Chief Justice should be referred to the Government of India alongwith the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the Chief Justice of India, the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs would submit the recommendation alongwith relevant papers to the Prime Minister who will then advise the President as to the transfer of the Judge concerned. After the President approves the transfer, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Department of Justice will inform the Chief Justice of the High Courts and the Chief Ministers of concerned States and will announce the transfer and issue the necessary notification in the Gazette of India. Transfer of Judge to or from Jammu &amp; Kashmir High Court shall be made in accordance with clause (1) of Article 222 of the Constitution of India read with Article 222 (1A) of the Constitution (Application to Jammu &amp; Kashmir) order, 1954. Therefore, when it is proposed to transfer a Judge from or to the Jammu &amp; Kashmir High Court, the Minister of Law and Justice in the Central Government will consult the Governor (Chief Minister) of Jammu &amp; Kashmir for his views before putting up the relevant papers to the Prime Minister for advising the President. In case there is a difference of opinion, the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs will consult the Chief Justice of India again before putting up the papers to the Prime Minister for advising the President on the matter of Transfer. On approval of the President, the transfer will be announced in the usual manner.

Article 348 (2) provides that the Governor of the State may, with the previous consent of the President, authorize the use of the Hindi language or any other language used for any official purpose of the State, in the proceedings of the High Court having its principal seat in that State provided that decrees, judgments or orders passed by such High Courts shall be in English. The Official Language Act, 1963 reiterates this and provides under Section 7 that the use of Hindi or official language of a State in addition to the English language may be authorized, with the consent of the President of India, by the Governor of the State for the purpose of judgments, decrees etc. made by the High Court for that State. No law has been made in this regard by the Parliament so far. Therefore, English continues to be the language for all the proceedings of the Supreme Court. The 18th Law Commission of India in its 216th Report on Non-Feasibility of Introduction of Hindi as Compulsory Language in the Supreme Court of India (2008) has, after detailed discussions with all stake-holders, inter-alia, recommended that the higher judiciary should not be subjected to any kind of even persuasive change in the present societal context. The Government has accepted the stand of the Commission. The use of Hindi has been authorized long back in the proceedings as well in the judgments, decrees or orders in the High Courts of the States of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Government of India had received proposals from the Government of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Karnataka to permit use of Tamil, Gujarati, Hindi, Bengali and Kannada in the proceedings of the Madras High Court, Gujarat High Court, Chhattisgarh High Court, Calcutta High Court and Karnataka High Court respectively. The advice of the Chief Justice of India was sought on these proposals as per a decision of Cabinet Committee taken in 1965 which provides that comments of the Chief Justice of India are necessary before considering any proposal for use of Hindi or any Regional language in the proceedings of a High Court. The Chief Justice of India vide his d.o. dated 16.10.2012 intimated that the Full Court, after due deliberations, decided not to accept the proposals. The Government has abided by the decision of the Supreme Court. Based on another request from the Government of Tamil Nadu, the Government requested the Chief Justice of India to review the earlier decisions in this regard vide. letter dated 04.07.2014 and convey the consent of the Supreme Court of India. Honble the Chief Justice of India vide his d.o. letter dated 18.01.2016 conveyed that the Full Court, after extensive deliberations disapproved the proposal and reiterated the earlier decisions of the Honble Court.

As India approaches its 75th Republic Day, the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law &amp; Justice has launched a significant initiative Samvidhan Katta, a celebration of Indian constitution through Dialogue and Awareness under the banner of Hamara Samvidhan, Hamara Samman. This campaign, rooted in the very essence of our constitutional values, seeks to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Indian Constitution among citizens. Samvidhan Katta, is designed to encourage dialogue and discussion about the Constitution, its principles, and its impact on the lives of the people of India. Significance Samvidhan Katta is a unique platform where individuals from all walks of lifestudents, scholars, legal professionals, and common citizenscome together to engage in meaningful conversations about the Constitution. The term Katta, as used by Honble Chief Justice of India- Dr. D.Y Chandrachud in the 2nd regional event held at Bikaner, Rajasthan. It is often associated with informal gatherings in Marathi language. It represents a space for open dialogue, where ideas and opinions can be freely exchanged. The objective of these sessions is to demystify the Constitution, making it accessible to everyone, and to highlight its role as a living document that protects the rights and liberties of all citizens. The Indian Constitution is not just a legal document; it is a charter of liberty and justice, enshrining the values of equality, dignity, and non-discrimination. The Department of Justice (DoJ) by this flagship event aims to push forward for the creation of Samvidhan Katta groups by providing resources, guides, and discussion materials. Whether its a small group of friends, a classroom, or a community center, any space can become a Samvidhan Katta. Join the movement, initiate your own Samvidhan Katta, share your stories, and contribute to embedding constitutional values deeply into our societys fabric Cases which can be included as stories Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992): Commonly known as the Mandal Commission case, this landmark judgment upheld the reservation policy for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in government jobs. The Supreme Court recognized that affirmative action is essential to address historical injustices faced by marginalized communities and to ensure their participation in public life, thereby reinforcing the constitutional mandate of equality. Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997): This case was a watershed moment in addressing gender discrimination and harassment in the workplace. The Supreme Court laid down guidelines, known as the Vishaka Guidelines, to prevent sexual harassment at the workplace, thereby protecting the dignity and safety of women. These guidelines were eventually codified into the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013. Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (2018): This landmark judgment decriminalized consensual same-sex relations, striking down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. The Supreme Court affirmed the constitutional right to equality, dignity, and privacy, thereby providing a significant victory for the LGBTQ+ community and challenging societal norms of discrimination. Indian Young Lawyers Association v. State of Kerala (2018): In this case, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing women of all ages to enter the Sabarimala Temple, striking down a centuries-old custom that barred women of menstruating age from entering the temple. The judgment was a significant step towards gender equality and non-discrimination based on gender and biological factors.

Articles 14 and 22(1) of the Constitution also make it obligatory for the State to ensure equality before law and a legal system which promotes justice on the basis of equal opportunity to all. In the year 1987, the Legal Services Authorities Act was enacted by the Parliament which came into force on 9th November, 1995 to establish a nationwide uniform network for providing free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of the society on the basis of equal opportunity. The National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) has been constituted under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 to monitor and evaluate implementation of legal aid programmes and to lay down policies and principles for making legal services available under the Act. In every State, a State Legal Services Authority and in every High Court, a High Court Legal Services Committee have been constituted. District Legal Services Authorities, Taluk Legal Services Committees have been constituted in the Districts and most of the Taluks to give effect to the policies and directions of the NALSA and to provide free legal services to the people and conduct Lok Adalats in the State. Supreme Court Legal Services Committee has been constituted to administer and implement the legal services programme insofar as it relates to the Supreme Court of India. Functioning of NALSA NALSA lays down policies, principles, guidelines and frames effective and economical schemes for the State Legal Services Authorities to implement the Legal Services Programmes throughout the country. Primarily, the State Legal Services Authorities, District Legal Services Authorities, Taluk Legal Services Committees, etc. have been asked to discharge the following main functions on regular basis: To Provide Free and Competent Legal Services to the eligible persons; To organize Lok Adalats for amicable settlement of disputes and To organize legal awareness camps in the rural areas. i.

It is a forum where the disputes/cases pending in the court of law or at pre-litigation stage are settled/compromised amicably. The Lok Adalat has been given statutory status under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. Under this Act, an award made by a Lok Adalat is deemed to be a decree of a civil court and is final and binding on all parties and no appeal lies against thereto before any court. Lok Adalats are being organized by the Legal Services Authorities/Committees for settlement of cases pending before courts u/s 19 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 and also for matters at pre-Litigative stage, under the guidance of NALSA. Chapter VI-A has been inserted in the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 in the year 2002, with a view to provide compulsory pre-Litigative mechanism for conciliation and settlement of disputes relating to Public Utility Services. Further in view of Covid, E-Lok Adalat has been conceptualized which significantly improved access to justice for people who were otherwise unable to participate in the Lok Adalats. iii.

The SOP has recently been finalized and circulated to the High Courts for their comments. The SOP plans to establish dedicated Judicial Digital Repositories (JDRs) at the High Court level to manage and preserve the digital records of the HCs as well as the district courts under its administrative control. Similar JDR is planned for the Supreme Court. The SOP recommends defining and implementing a comprehensive Information Governance (IG) policy considering the enormous volume of e-filing and production of digital records by the courts. It provides comprehensive technical specifications, open standard based file formats and guidelines for digitization. It provides guidelines for preparation of Submission Information Package (SIP) and method for transfer of digitized records to JDR. The Judicial Digital Repositories (JDRs) have to be audited and certified as per the ISO 16363 for their overall trustworthiness and reliability in the long-term considering the need for legal admissibility of digital records. As on 14.06.2024, 311.10 Cr. pages have been digitized across High Courts and District Courts.

Online payment of court fees, fines, penalties and judicial deposits has been initiated through https://pay.ecourts.gov.in from 14th August 2018. Introduction of electronic collection of court fees and other civil payments requires appropriate amendments in the existing Court Fees Act enacted by the various State Governments besides opening a bank account in a Nationalized Bank or in other bank suitable to receive, hold and disburse such payments electronically. DoJ has taken up the matter with Chief Secretaries and Registrar General of High Courts to expedite the enactment / modification in existing enactment to enable epayment of court fees. The eCommittee of the Supreme Court has also proposed that since the existing Court Fees Act provides for refunds, administrative instructions may be issued by High Courts to allow one-time lump sum deposit as court fees which can be adjusted and balance refunded at the end of the proceedings in the same manner that court fees in respect of proceedings withdrawn or compromise are refunded in part. A total of 22 High Courts have implemented ePayments in their respective jurisdictions whereas the Court Fees Act has been amended in 24 High Courts till 30.06.2024. The ePayments can be enabled through an electronic payment process like SBI ePay, GRAS, e-GRAS, JeGRAS, HimKosh etc.Apart from payments being made through credit / debit cards and bank transfers, other applications like BHIM App, RuPay etc. can also be leveraged along with private wallets like Paytm, Google Pay etc. For more information, please visit https://pay.ecourts.gov.in/epay/ Website Policies Hyperlinking Policy Copyright Policy Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Feedback Contact Us Help FAQ WIM Visitor Summary Content Owned by DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, Ministry of Law and Justice, GOI Developed and hosted by National Informatics Centre, Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology, Government of India Last Updated: Sep 04, 2024 Certified Quality Website window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('set', 'cookie_flags', 'SameSite=Lax;Secure'); gtag('config', 'G-B2ES66Q14T'); jQuery(document).ready(function($){ jQuery('body').find('a.flex-pause').attr('href',\"javascript:void(0)\"); $('.flex-direction-nav a.flex-prev').attr({'title' : 'Previous','aria-label':'Previous'}); $('.flex-pauseplay a.flex-pause').attr({'title' : 'Play/Pause','aria-label':'Play/Pause'}); $('.flex-direction-nav a.flex-next').attr({'title' : 'Next','aria-label':'Next'}); }); /* */ /* */ jQuery(document).ready(function ($) { $.post({ url: ajaxurl, method: 'POST', dataType: 'JSON', data: { time: new Date().getTime(), lang: 'en', action: 's3waas_pll_lang_cookie' }, success: function (responseResults) {} }) }) (function() { var expirationDate = new Date(); expirationDate.setTime( expirationDate.getTime() + 31536000 * 1000 ); document.cookie = \"pll_language=en; expires=\" + expirationDate.toUTCString() + \"; path=/; domain=doj.gov.in; secure; SameSite=Lax\"; }());"

The concept is aimed at reducing footfalls in the courts by eliminating the physical presence of violator or advocate in the court. Virtual court can be managed by virtual judge whose jurisdiction can be extended to entire state and working hours may be 24X7. Neither litigant need to come to court nor judge will have to physically preside over the court. Thus, precious judicial time and manpower will be saved. As on 30.06.2024, there are 28 such courts in 21 States / UTs viz. Delhi (2), Haryana, Chandigarh, Gujarat (2), Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala (2), Maharashtra (2), Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir (2), Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Meghalaya, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand (2), Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Manipur (2). Facility is provided for Litigants to file the plaint electronically through e-Filing and pay the Court Fees or Fine online through pay.ecourts.gov.in. Litigant can view the status of the case also online through various channels created for service delivery hence the entire exercise can be done sitting at home. Over 5.26 crore cases have been handled by 28 virtual courts and in more than 56 lakhs cases, online fine of more than Rs. 579.40 crores have been realized till 30.06.2024.

Data is updated on a near real-time basis by the connected District and Taluka courts. It provides data relating to judicial proceedings/decisions of all computerized district and subordinate courts of the country. All High Courts have also joined the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) through web services, providing easy access facility to the litigant public. Through the eCourts services platform using elastic search technology, currently litigants can access case status information in respect of 26.06 crore cases and more than 26.91 crore orders / judgments pertaining to these computerized courts as on date. On 14.09.2023, Supreme Court of India has onboarded its data on National Judicial Data Grid. Case data is available on NJDG for both civil and criminal cases with the ability to perform drill-down analysis based on the age of the case as well as the State and District. NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage &amp; reduce pendency of cases. It helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delays in disposing of cases and helps in reducing case pendency. It also facilitates better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, serves as an efficient resource management tool. To track cases related to land disputes, Land Records data of 26 States have been linked with NJDG. World Bank praised the National Judicial Data Grid in the Ease of Doing Business report for 2018, that it made possible to generate case management reports, thereby making it easier to enforce contracts. In consonance with the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) announced by the Government of India, Open Application Programming Interface (API) has been provided to the Central &amp; State Government to allow easy access to the NJDG data using a departmental ID and access key. This will allow the institutional litigants to access the NJDG data for their evaluation and monitoring purposes. It is proposed to expand the facility to non-institutional litigants as well in future. Recently, reasons for delay have been included in NJDG. The inclusion of feature specifying the reasons for delay on the NJDG portal has the potential to keep a proper track on issues which the judiciary faces while adjudicating cases and consequently enables them and the decision makers to take various steps in the direction of redressing the burgeoning pendency of cases. Apart from that, individual reason for delay highlights the problems at a granular level, which otherwise would be cumbersome to be tracked upon and thereby remedied.

The Family Courts Act, 1984 provides for the establishment of Family Courts by the State Governments in consultation with the High Courts to promote conciliation and secure speedy settlement of disputes relating to marriage and family affairs. As per the Act, it is mandatory for the State Government to set up a Family Court for every city or a town whose population exceeds one million. In other areas of the States, the Family Courts may be set up if the State Governments deems it necessary.

Incidents of sexual offences and prolonged trials of accused necessitated dedicated court machinery to provide immediate relief to the victims. Since October 2019, the Department of Justice is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, to set up Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) including exclusive POCSO Courts across the nation for expeditious trial relating to sexual offences. Each court comprises of 1 Judicial Officer and 7 Staff Members. Out of 31 States and UTs eligible, 30 have joined this scheme. Puducherry made a special request to join the Scheme and the one exclusive POCSO Court was operationalized in May, 2023. The Scheme was initially for a period of one year spread over two Financial Years 2019-20 and 2020-21 at a total outlay of Rs. 767.25 Cr. with Rs. 474 Cr. as Central Share to be met from Nirbhaya Fund. The Cabinet approved the continuation of the Scheme for two years i.e. up to March, 2023 with a total budgetary outlay of Rs. 1572.86 Cr. with Rs.971.70 Cr. as central share. The Union Cabinet in its meeting held on 28.11.2023 has further extended the Scheme for another three years  from 01.04.2023 to 31.03.2026, at a total financial outlay of Rs. 1952.23 Cr. including Rs. 1207.24 Cr. as Central Share to be incurred from Nirbhaya Fund. In F.Y. 2019-20, Rs. 140 Cr, in F.Y. 2020-21 Rs.160.00 Cr, in F.Y. 2021-22, Rs.134.56 Cr, in F.Y. 2022-23, Rs. 200.00 Cr and in the F.Y. 2023-24, Rs. 200.00 Cr. was released to States/UTs as Central Share. As on May 2024, 755 FTSCs including 410 exclusive POCSO (ePOCSO) Courts are functional in 30 States / UTs which have disposed of more than 2,53,000 pending cases. In the current F.Y 2024-25, a total of Rs. 200.00 Cr. has been allocated. For the robust implementation of the Scheme, this Department has created an online monitoring framework for monthly monitoring of case statistics. Regular review meetings with the Registrar Generals of High Courts and State functionaries are being undertaken.

The Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) index was a ranking system established bythe World Bank Group wherein the higher rankings (a lower numerical value)indicated better and usually simpler regulations for businesses and strongerprotections of property rights.The Ease Of Doing Business Score showed an economys absolute positionrelative to the best regulatory performance, whereas the ease of doing businessranking was an indication of an economys position relative to that of othereconomies. The Enforcing Contracts indicator measured the time and cost for the resolution of a standardized commercial dispute as well as a series of good practices in the judiciary. Therefore, Time, Cost and Quality of Judicial Process were the three variables which the World Bank had taken into account for ranking the countries on the Enforcing Contracts parameter of the Ease of Doing Business Ranking. Only Delhi and Mumbai were under the purview of the Ease of Doing Business survey by World Bank. The Department of Justice is the nodal department for the Enforcing Contracts Indicator. The Government of India has been aggressively pursuing various reform measures to create an effective, efficient, transparent and robust Contract Enforcement Regime. Several rounds of meetings have been held with the judicial and legal fraternity, educational institutions, leading law firms, corporate bodies, etc. to work in an integrated manner to improve the quality and efficiency of commercial courts. The Doing Business Report by World Bank Group has been discontinued. The World Bank is working on a new and more comprehensive framework called Business-Ready for assessing the business and investment climate in economies worldwide. Methodology Home Methodology The data for the Ease of Doing Business rankings was collected by a combination of study of the codes of civil procedure, court regulations as well as questionnaires survey by local litigation lawyers and judges. *Source : World Bank Group The performance of any country in Enforcing Contracts indicator was measured on the basis of the following parameters: Time Estimates For Commercial Cases This includes time taken during filing and service phase, trial and judgment phase, and enforcement of judgment phase. Cost Estimates For Commercial Cases This includes attorney fees, court fees (up to judgment only) and expert fees, and enforcement fees. Quality of Judicial Process Index Resolution This includes court structure and proceedings, case management, court automation, and alternative dispute resolution. RANKING Home RANKING The Overall Rank of India in the Doing Business Report 2015 was 142 out of 190 economies.
